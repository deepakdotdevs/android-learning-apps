# 📱 Android Learning Apps  

**Welcome to my Android Learning Journey! 🚀**  
This repository — **`android-learning-apps`** — is a personal collection of Android projects I’m building while learning **Android development using Java and XML**.  
Currently, it includes my first app — **Intent App** — demonstrating both **Explicit** and **Implicit Intents** in Android.

## 🧠 About This Repository  

This repository is designed to help me (and other beginners) understand how Android apps work — from activities and intents to layouts and app flow.  
Each project folder contains complete source code, documentation, and screenshots for easy understanding.
